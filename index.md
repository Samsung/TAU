# TAU Introduction

TAU is the standard web UI library for Tizen platform. The acronym stands for Tizen
Advanced UI Library. It is a collection of UI controls called *widgets* which simplify
application coding.

## Benefits

When using TAU you will get many benefits usable in your code:

* A standalone library, meaning no additional libraries are needed
* Written with speed in mind, all of the code is tweaked for maximum performance
* Application can be _built_ to dramatically improve startup performance
* Large and open API, methods and core function (event utility functions) are available and not hidden to the developer
* Customizable, easy to extend (and create new widgets)
* Optimized for wearable, mobile and TV devices
* Supports device profiles (mobile, wearable and TV)

## Getting started
There are few simple possibilites to get started using TAU

### Using Tizen Studio
1. Download and install [Tizen SDK](https://developer.tizen.org/)
2. Use wizard to create Sample Web App TAU project. TAU library will be already included

### Using WATT
Note: Online WATT server is currently under preparation.
You can find out more about WATT
[here](https://github.com/Samsung/WATT/)

### Using VSCode
You can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with set of extensions supporting web apps and TAU development.
Note: Currently Tizen/TAU specific extensions are under development.

### Including TAU in your source code
```html
<script src="../lib/tau/mobile/js/tau.js"></script>
```
## Where to get it
* [TAU source code](https://github.com/Samsung/TAU/)
* [TAU releases](docs/guide/source/releases.md)
  * [latest release](https://github.com/Samsung/TAU/releases/latest)

## Simple usage example
```html
<div class="ui-page ui-page-active">
  <div class="ui-header">MyApplication</div>
  <div class="ui-content">Hello world</div>
  <div class="ui-footer">
    <button id="closeBtn" class="ui-btn">Close</button>
  </div>
</div>
<script>
    var page = document.querySelector(".ui-page");
    page.addEventListener("pageshow", function () {
      document.getElementById("closeBtn").addEventListener("click", function () {
        window.close();
      });
    });
</script>
```

## History

TAU originated from Tizen Web UI Framework Library (standard library for Tizen 2.2.1),
which was mainly based as an extension to jQuery Mobile. Key features of the former were
coding simplification and app creation speed. With that in mind TAU was created as the
framework *advanced to the next level*. TAU is a standalone UI library, without jQuery
overhead, but that duo can be used as explained in this [guide later](using_jquery_with_tau.html).
