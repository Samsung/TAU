# API Docs

TAU documentation is written in JSDuck format which is a standard in javascript code.
JSDuck format is easy to read, informative and allows for pecise type documentation.

When using tau the full library version (not the minified one) contains all comments
that are included in the autogenerated documents below.

Please bare in mind that while TAU aims for a solid framework unified across multiple
device types, there are differences thats why the API Doc was splitet in profiles like
all the examples included in this guide.

[Wearable API Doc](api/wearable)
